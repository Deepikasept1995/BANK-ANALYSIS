Bank Data Analysis - Power BI Dashboard

Overview

This Power BI dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of bank loan data, covering key metrics such as total loan applications, funded amounts, received amounts, debt-to-income ratio (DTI), and interest rates. The dashboard helps stakeholders visualize trends, compare performance across different dimensions, and make data-driven decisions.

## Key Metrics & Visuals

1. ### Overview Section
	•	Total Loan Applications: Displays the total number of loan applications received.
	•	Total Funded Amount: Shows the total value of loans funded.
	•	Total Amount Received: Represents the total amount recovered from loans.
	•	Average DTI (Debt-to-Income Ratio): Indicates the average borrower DTI percentage.
	•	Average Interest Rate: Displays the average interest rate across all loans.

2. ### Loan Performance Analysis
	•	Month-wise Funded Amount: A trend chart showing funding patterns over different months.
	•	State-wise Funded Amount: A geographic heatmap displaying the distribution of funded loans across states.
	•	Total Funded Amount by Term: Compares loans based on their tenure (e.g., 3 years, 5 years).
	•	Total Funded Amount by Employee Length: Analyzes how funding varies based on borrower employment duration.
	•	Total Funded Amount by Purpose: Highlights the primary purposes for which loans were taken.

Data Sources

The dashboard is built using a structured dataset containing loan applications, funding amounts, customer details, and repayment performance. The data is likely sourced from financial institutions, lending platforms, or open financial datasets.

Tools & Technologies
	•	Power BI: Used for data visualization and dashboard creation.
	•	SQL: Data preprocessing and transformation.

### How to Use the Dashboard
	1.	Filter Data: Use slicers to analyze specific loan grades, loan terms, and other parameters.
	2.	Explore Trends: Review funding trends over time to identify seasonality or growth patterns.
	3.	Compare Metrics: Assess the impact of employment length, loan purpose, and geographic location on loan funding.
	4.	Decision Making: Use insights to optimize loan approval strategies and risk assessment.

### Future Enhancements
	•	Integration with real-time data sources.
	•	Predictive analytics for loan default probability.
	•	Advanced drill-down capabilities for deeper analysis.
